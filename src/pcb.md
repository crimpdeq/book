# PCB

The PCB design is maintained in the [`crimpdeq-hardware` repository](https://github.com/crimpdeq/crimpdeq-hardware) and was created with KiCad. It is a two-layer board derived from the [ESP32-C3-DevKit-RUST-1](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-rust-board). This variant removes unused sensors from the original design and adds only the components required for this project.

> ⚠️ **Status**: The PCB has not been fabricated yet and is therefore untested.

## Advanced Version

The [`crimpdeq-board` repository](https://github.com/crimpdeq/crimpdeq-board) contains an advanced version of the PCB that includes additional sensors and other improvements.

> ⚠️ **Status**: This version is still a work in progress: routing is incomplete, and it has not been fabricated or tested. There is no estimated timeline for availability.
